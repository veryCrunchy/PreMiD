- Under Discord settings, navigate to **Activity Settings** > **Activity Privacy** > **Share your detected activities with others.** and ensure this setting is _on_.
- Ensure you have **no** other games or programs running that will take priority.
- Navigate to a presence-enabled site or [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw) to test your PreMiD with YouTube.

## Part 2: Presence Fixing

- Turn on your presence and ensure privacy mode is **off**
- Right-click the extension in your **browser** and go to "Manage"
- Check under "Site access" and make sure the correct pages are enabled.

![Browser Extension Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-browser.png)

- You can do this with "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit" "On click"
- Once you go to those pages, _click_ the extension to ensure it's active for those sites. Re-load any pages after.
- Go to PreMiD and select your icon to see settings. Ensure "Enabled" is on, or "Paused" is _Not_ on in newer versions.
  - You can turn "Enabled" **off** and back **on** to jumpstart the extension. (In newer versions, this is "PAUSED" and can be flipped **on** then **off**)
  - Sometimes just turning "Use Playing Status" **off** and back **on** will cause the presence to load.
- In your _web browser, fully reload all pages using PreMiD or restart the browser_
  - Most problems can be fixed by relaunching your web browser!
- Finally, you should see your activity.

## Part 3: Kickstarts

If **all of the above steps were followed in order:**

![YouTube Presence Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-ytsetting.png)

- Turn Privacy mode On and Off. If using YouTube there may be an icon in the bottom of a video with a slash through an eye. Click this! Give it a moment to load and check your Discord Status.
- Turn "Enabled" off and on. (In newer versions, this is "PAUSED" and can be flipped **on** then **off**)

![PreMiD Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-pmsetting.png)

- Check the store page for your presence, as sometimes it only activates from certain web URLS.
  - _EG: Soundcloud will only work if the page listed in the presence store is from "Soundcloud.com" You cannot use other hosts!_
- Fully check your Web Extension > Manage page and ensure it is set up to work.
  - _EG: "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit > On Specific Sites" "https://www.youtube.com/"_
  - _Note: An "\*"/Asterisk is a wildcard value, meaning any page from that host can be accessed._
- After any changes are made, it's always a good idea to close your web browser and Discord to reload.
