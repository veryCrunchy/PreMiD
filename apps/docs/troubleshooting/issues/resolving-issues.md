## Browser Connections

> [!NOTE]
> You have to open a new tab and navigate to your presence-site of choice after each change. Simply navigating back to an active tab will usually not work.

- Select the malfunctioning presence and ensure the presence is **ON**/Privacy Mode is **OFF**
- Right-click the extension in your **browser** under your extension menu and select "Manage"
  - This may have a different name depending on your browser software.
- Check under "Site Access" to make sure the correct pages are enabled.

![Browser Extension Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-browser.png)

- You can do this with "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit" "On click"
- Once you go to those pages, _click_ the extension to ensure it's active for those sites. Re-load any pages after.
- Go to PreMiD and select your icon to see settings. Ensure "Enabled" is on, or "Paused" is _Not_ on in newer versions.
  - You can turn "Enabled" **OFF** and back **ON** to force a reconnect in older versions.
    - In newer versions, this is "PAUSED" and can be flipped **ON** then **OFF**, however this is not needed.
  - Sometimes just turning "Use Playing Status" **OFF** and back **ON** will cause the presence to load.
- In your _web browser, fully relaunch all pages using PreMiD, use CTRL+F5 to hard refresh, or duplicate the tabs, or restart the browser_
  - Most problems can be fixed by relaunching your web browser!
- Finally, you should see your activity.

## Forcing Reconnections

> [!NOTE]
> This is ONLY for the current release version of PreMiD. If you are currently running the Beta or the Alpha version of the program you should NOT need to do this.

![YouTube Presence Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-ytsetting.png)

- Turn Privacy mode **ON** then **OFF**.
  - If using YouTube there may be an icon in the bottom of a video with a slash through an eye. If this is visible; it means "Privacy Overwrite Mode" is enabled.
  - Click the icon or turn off the mode. Give it a moment to load and check your Discord Status.
- Turn "Enabled" **OFF** and **ON**.

## Observances

- Check the store page for your presence. They only work from certain URL's.
  - _EG: Soundcloud will only work if the page listed in the presence store is from "Soundcloud.com" You cannot use other hosts!_
- Fully check your Web Extension > Manage page and ensure it is set up to work.
  - _EG: "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit > On Specific Sites" "https://www.youtube.com/"_
  - _Note: An "\*"/Asterisk is a wildcard value, meaning any page from that host can be accessed._
- After any changes are made, it's always a good idea to close your web browser and Discord to reload.
