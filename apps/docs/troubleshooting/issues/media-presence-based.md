# _Media-Presence-Based Problems_

## Netflix Malfunction

<sub>_"Netflix isn't registering anything at all!"_</sub>

- Close and reopen your web browser. If this does not resolve the problem, move on to the next steps.
- Check your Netflix settings under the PreMiD presence extension, verifying there are no privacy settings enabled.
- Turn off the presence (disable the switch-box) and re-enable the presence (turn on the switch-box)
- Refresh your Netflix page.
- Check Discord. It should hook-in. If it does not, refresh the Netflix page again.
- If the extension is not registering Netflix after following all steps in the FIRST section of this thread:
  - Ensure you're waiting **15-30 SECONDS** between changes before checking your status. It can take some time to register changes.
  - Make sure the ACTIVE BROWSER PAGE is NETFLIX and the WEB URL is "Netflix.com"
- Make sure you have checked your Extension Permissions to run on that page.
  - Open Netflix, right-click the PreMiD extension and select: _PAGE ACCESS > ALWAYS RUN ON SITE_

## Netflix Thumbnails

<sub>_"Netflix Thumbnails aren't working!"_</sub>

> [!NOTE]
>Most of the time this problem is caused by privacy mode being enabled.

- Tick **Privacy Mode** **on and off**.
- If there are settings for the Netflix presence to have a still-frame thumbnail or a media-specific one, set the option you prefer under the presence settings.
- Turn off the presence (disable the switch-box) and re-enable the presence (turn on the switch-box)

## Netflix Metadata

<sub>_"Netflix Isn't showing titles!"_</sub>

- Open the Netflix Presence under PreMiD and do the following:
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Mode**
- Reload the video page. You should now see the title and timestamp after a number of seconds.

## YouTube Malfunction

<sub>_"YouTube isn't registering anything at all!"_</sub>

- Close and reopen your web browser. If this does not resolve the problem, move on to the next steps.
- Check your YouTube settings under the PreMiD presence extension, verifying there are no privacy settings enabled.
- Turn off the presence (disable the switch-box) and re-enable the presence (turn on the switch-box)
- Refresh your YouTube page.
- Check Discord. It should hook-in. If it does not, refresh the YouTube page again.
- If the extension is not registering YouTube after following all steps in the FIRST section of this thread:
  - Ensure you're waiting **15-30 SECONDS** between changes before checking your status. It can take some time to register changes.
  - Make sure the ACTIVE BROWSER PAGE is YouTube and the WEB URL is _"YouTube.com"_
- Make sure you have checked your Extension Permissions to run on that page.
  - Open YouTube, right-click the PreMiD extension and select: _PAGE ACCESS > ALWAYS RUN ON SITE_

> [!NOTE]
>Most of the time this problem is caused by privacy mode being enabled.

- Tick **Privacy Mode** **on and off**.
- If you have **Privacy Overwrite** enabled, turn it off.
- Go to the YouTube Presence in the extension. Ensure you have the "THUMBNAIL" setting turned ON.

## YouTube Metadata

<sub>_"YouTube Isn't showing titles!"_</sub>

![YouTube Presence Settings](/guide-images/gu-p1-ytsetting.png)

- Open the YouTube Presence under PreMiD and do the following:
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Mode**
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Overwrite Button**
- Reload the video page. You should now see the title and timestamp after a number of seconds.

## Other: MetaData/Thumbnails Not Appearing

<sub>_"Video or Audio Presence isn't showing my media names or images!"_</sub>

> [!NOTE]
>Most media presences have a privacy mode. Some are enabled by default and will need to be turned off.

- Open the Presence under PreMiD and do the following:
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Mode**
  - (If the presence has the setting) Turn OFF **Privacy Overwrite Button**
  - (Optional) Turn ON **Show Title As Presence** (This setting MAY NOT be applicable!)
- Reload the video page. You should now see the title and timestamp after a number of seconds.
- Some presences may not have thumbnail information (EG: Plex) 

## Other: Timestamp Malfunction

<sub>_"Timestamps are not working!"_</sub>

- This is either a Discord Visual Glitch, or requires some tweaking on the presence. Before panicking, check your profile on another device. It's likely working fine.
- This can also be a result of the presence not having "Show Timestamps" selected in the options. Ensure you have the presence configured properly.
- You may also want to ensure **Privacy Mode** is not enabled.
