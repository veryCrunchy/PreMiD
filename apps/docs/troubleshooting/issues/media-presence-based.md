# _Media-Presence-Based Problems_

## Netflix

### "Netflix Thumbnails aren't working!"

- Most of the time this problem is caused by **privacy mode being enabled.**
- If you're having issues getting your media to register, tick **Privacy Mode** **on and off**.
- If there are settings for the Netflix presence to have a still-frame thumbnail or a media-specific one, set the option you prefer under the presence settings.
- Turn off the presence (disable the switch-box) and re-enable the presence (turn on the switch-box)

### "Netflix isn't registering anything at all!"

- Close your Web Browser, Close Discord. Reopen your web browser.
- Check your Netflix settings under the PreMiD presence extension, verifying there are no privacy settings enabled.
- Turn off the presence (disable the switch-box) and re-enable the presence (turn on the switch-box)
- Refresh your Netflix page.
- Start Discord. It should hook-in. If it does not, refresh the Netflix page again.
- If the extension is not registering Netflix after following all steps in the FIRST section of this thread:
  - Ensure you're waiting **15-30 SECONDS** between changes before checking your status. It can take some time to register changes.
  - Make sure the ACTIVE BROWSER PAGE is NETFLIX and the WEB URL is "Netflix.com"
- Make sure you have checked your Extension Permissions to run on that page.
  - Open Netflix, right-click the PreMiD extension and select: _PAGE ACCESS > ALWAYS RUN ON SITE_

## YouTube

### "YouTube Thumbnails aren't working!"

- Follow the troubleshooting guide above to ensure you're fully linked between PreMiD and Discord. Most of the time this problem is caused by **privacy mode being enabled.**
- If you're having issues getting your media to register, tick **Privacy Mode** **on and off**.
- If you have **Privacy Overwrite** enabled, turn it off.
- Go to the YouTube Presence in the extension. Ensure you have the "THUMBNAIL" setting turned ON.

### "YouTube Isn't showing titles!"

- Open the YouTube Presence under PreMiD and do the following:
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Mode**
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Overwrite Button**
- Reload the video page. You should now see the title and timestamp after a number of seconds.

### "YouTube isn't registering anything at all!"

## Other

### "Video or Audio Presence isn't showing my media names or images!"

- Open the Presence under PreMiD and do the following:
  - Turn OFF **Privacy Mode**
  - (If the presence has the setting) Turn OFF **Privacy Overwrite Button**
  - (Optional) Turn ON **Show Title As Presence** (This setting MAY NOT be applicable!)
- Reload the video page. You should now see the title and timestamp after a number of seconds.

### "Timestamps are not working!"

- This is either a Discord Visual Glitch, or requires some tweaking on the presence. Before panicking, check your profile on another device. It's likely working fine.
