# Manually Installing/No Extension Store

<sub>_"I don't know how to install a zip file!"_</sub>

- If given a zip file for your installation of PreMiD, it will be browser-dependent on how to navigate to the correct pages.
- Know whether your browser is based on **Chromium**, **Safari** or **Firefox**'s architecture. This will make a difference for installation and change the base file that you need.
  - Each browser generally uses one of these three backend systems. Opera/Opera GX/Edge all use Chromium, as an example.

## Firefox-Based Extension

- Navigate to the top right of your browser page. Click the Puzzle-Piece icon.
- Under the menu, select **Extensions**.

- When in the Extensions menu, you will see a cog at the mid-right corner of the page. Select it.
- You will see "Install Extension from File."
- Select your PreMiD zip-file. You do **not have to unzip it.**
- Enable the extension.

## Chromium-Based Extension

- Navigate to the top right of your browser page. Click the Puzzle-Piece or box-shaped icon.
  - Between browsers this may look different. This demonstration was captured on Opera GX.
- Under the menu, select **Manage Extensions**.

- When in the Extensions menu, you can either select **Load Unpacked Extension** or grab the zip-file from your download location and drag it into the extension screen.
- Enable the extension.

## Post-Installation

![Pin PreMiD](/guide-images/gu-pmcffg.png)

- Open your Extensions menu and pin PreMiD for easy access later.
- Click the PreMiD extension to bring up the Discord login menu.

- After logging in, the <span style="color:Red">**Red Exclamation Point (!)**</span> will disappear. You can now use PreMiD normally.
- Manually installing has no negative impact on your ability to use any of the PreMiD functions.
- If you are installing manually as an update, be sure to _remove the previous install_ from your extensions menu.
- If updating via manual installation, you will have to visit the [PreMiD Store](https://premid.app/store) to re-add your non-default presences.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps generally remain the same between installations.
